# Process

## Data Collection
-Collected Netflix-style datasets including subscription, consumption, and catalogue data.

## Data Cleaning & Analysis (SQL)
Used SQL to clean data, join tables, and calculate KPIs related to revenue, user behavior, and content performance.

## Data Modeling (Power BI)
Created a star schema and built relationships between fact and dimension tables.

## Dashboard Development (Power BI)
Designed interactive dashboards using KPI cards, charts, and slicers.

## Insight Generation
Analyzed trends in watch time, user engagement, and content performance to derive business insights.

## Project Insights
- Repeat users contribute significantly to total watch time, showing strong user retention.
- Watch time shows clear month-on-month growth trends.
- Mobile devices are the most used platform for content consumption.
- Foreign content accounts for a large share of watch time.
- High completion rates indicate strong user engagement.
- A small set of content drives a major portion of total views.

## Final Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI can be combined to transform raw streaming data into meaningful business insights.

Using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization helped uncover patterns in user behavior, content performance, and platform engagement.

The analysis highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in improving user retention, optimizing content strategy, and tracking platform growth.
